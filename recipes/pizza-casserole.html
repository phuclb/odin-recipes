  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This pizza casserole recipe takes all the good things we love on pizza and combines them with egg noodles to form a great one-dish casserole to feed your family.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups uncooked egg noodles</li>
    <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>16 ounces pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup sliced pepperoni sausage</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess fat from the skillet. Stir in cooked egg noodles, pizza sauce, pepperoni, and milk until well combined. Pour mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and continue baking until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
  </ol>
